		<div class="content">
			<div class="box" id="faq-what"><h3>What is LexSciBowl?</h3>
				<p>
				LexSciBowl is an all-new student-run middle school science competition, run by members of the Lexington High School Science Bowl Team for teams in the Greater Boston Area. Teams of 4-5 members will compete in both a written olympiad modeled on the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Science_Olympiad">International Science Olympiads</a> and a buzzer tournament modeled on the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/">National Science Bowl</a>.
					<!--Team members and local scientists will also be giving talks on all sorts of science topics!-->
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-where"><h3>When and where?</h3>
				<p>
				We're holding LexSciBowl at <a href="//www.google.com/maps/place/Lexington+High+School/">Lexington High School</a> in the Science Lecture Hall. Just show up at one of the entrances to the school between 8:00 and 8:30 on May 16, and signs and volunteers will direct you to the right place. (see the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> for more details)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-who"><h3>Who can participate?</h3>
				<p>
				Our competition is targeted toward middle school students (5-8 grades), but we can also accept younger students if they feel they are ready! Although age and experience will certainly help a team get further in the elimination tournament, there will be multiple brackets to allow all students to participate in as many rounds of competition as possible.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-cost"><h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
				<p>
				Zero dollars and zero cents. Our operational costs are pretty low, and they are all paid for by lunch pizza pre-orders - so you can support us by buying some pizza! (See <a href="#faq-eat">How will I eat?</a>)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-eat"><h3>How will I eat?</h3>
				<p>
				Lunch will be during Breaktime<!--/Talktime, which is an hour and a half long and includes science talks!-->. You have a few options for lunch:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can pre-order whole pizzas for $12 per pie online before the competition, or for $15 per pie at the competition, or $2 per slice.
					All profits go toward running LexSciBowl. (The pre-order form will be sent out right after registration closes)</li>
					<li>You can go to Lexington Center, which is a few minutes' walk away. Coaches or parents must accompany students.</li>
					<li>Finally, you can always pack your own lunch.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-bring"><h3>What should I bring?</h3>
				<p>
				Typical test-taking implements (pencils, erasers). Note that calculators are not allowed. You should also bring money to buy food (or a packed lunch). (See <a href="faq-eat">How will I eat?</a>)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-practice"><h3>What do questions look like? How can I practice?</h3>
				<p>
				For the Lightning Rounds, National Science Bowl has a huge number of middle school science bowl <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/middle-school/middle-school-regionals/ms-rules-forms-resources/sample-questions/" rel="external">sample questions</a>, and we also have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yrv0VbYL3zDiyfmMWgWQg_KHaURexFZiRCu4WZXDAkI/edit">our own</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the Olympiad Rounds, well, the high school olympiads are vastly more difficult, and as far as we know this has never been done for middle school before. They will be somewhat similar to MCAS short-response questions in format, and slightly greater in difficulty.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-why"><h3>Why?</h3>
				<p>
				A few months ago, some members of our school Science Bowl team decided it might be cool to bring our love of high school science bowl to middle schools in the region. The National Science Bowl has only a relatively small Middle School division, and the International Science Olympiads seem to have no middle school equivalent. Especially in Massachusetts, there are math leagues and competitions galore. Why not science?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-signup"><h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
				<p>
				Right here! There's a <a href="#register">registration form</a> at the bottom of this page. You have to sign up as an adult-sponsored team, so see if a teacher or parent will be willing to organize it!.
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Please note</b> that, although a school may register multiple teams, we require that each team be accompanied by their own adult coach; this adult may be a parent, teacher, or otherwise, and must remain with the team the whole day (except while the Olympiad Round is being written).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-parents"><h3>What do parents/coaches do?</h3>
				<p>
				As long as each team of 4-5 has one adult supervising at all times, you have the option of leaving or accompanying students to all Lightning rounds.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box" id="faq-idk"><h3>I still don't get it!</h3>
				<p>
				If you still have something to ask, please shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:contact@lexscibowl.org">contact@lexscibowl.org</a>! We'll be happy to answer any questions you might have.
